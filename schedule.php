		<h2>Friday 7/10</h2>
		<p>
			<strong>Pizza Party</strong><br>
			If you're around Friday night and looking for company, we'd love to see you. We'll be hanging out at the venue for a few hours. We'll have a mobile pizza oven to serve you some super fresh pizza (including gluten free, dairy free, and vegan options).
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>When:</strong> 6:00pm - 9:00pm<br>
			<strong>Where:</strong> Friendly Crossways<br>
			<strong>Wear:</strong> Super casual<br>
		</p>
		
		<h2>Saturday 7/11</h2>
		<p>
			<strong>Wedding</strong><br>
			This is the important part. Benna and Andrew will say nice things to each other while everyone watches. Then we'll eat a bit. We'll drink. We'll eat some more. Many of us will dance. It'll be a grand old time.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>When:</strong> 5:00pm - 12:00am<br>
			<strong>Where:</strong> Friendly Crossways<br>
			<strong>Wear:</strong> Look decent, but don't stress it. Some people will be wearing suits and some people won't. It's summer. Stay cool. Oliver — you're welcome to wear that robe or gown or whatever it was you were talking about.
		</p>

		<h2>Sunday 7/12</h2>
		<p>
			<strong>Brunch / Lunch</strong><br>
			Rise and shine. Come eat and hang out with us before you go. There will be a Chinese roast pig 燒豬, as well as other non-pig things to eat (like fruit, bagels, eggs, coffee, tea, maybe some croissants).
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>When:</strong> 11:00am - 1:30pm<br>
			<strong>Where:</strong> Friendly Crossways<br>
			<strong>Wear:</strong> Also super casual

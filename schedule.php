		<h2>Friday 10/23</h2>

		<h3>Pizza Party</h3>

		<h2>Saturday 10/24</h2>

		<h3>Wedding</h3>
		<div class="info">This is the important part. Benna and Andrew will say nice things to each other while everyone watches. Then we'll eat a bit. We'll drink. We'll eat some more. Many of us will dance. It'll be a grand old time.</div>
		<p>
			When: 5:00pm - 11:00pm<br>
			Where: Friendly Crossways<br>
			Wear: Some people would argue that weddings require a certain degree of formaility in attire. We're not those people. Some people will be wearing suits and some people won't, and that's totally fine. Oliver — you're welcome to wear that robe or gown or whatever it was you were talking about.

		<h2>On-Site Lodging</h2>
		<p>There are a limited number of rooms at the venue itself, and we’d love to get as many of you on-site as we can. It’s pretty rustic and not quite as luxurious as a hotel, but it is cheap and super convenient. Some rooms are private and some are shared, with 2, 3, 4, and 6 or more beds in a room. If you are cool with sharing a room, we can put you up for free! If you claim one of the more private (3 or less), it is $50 per guest per night. Let us know if you’re interested!</p>
